## 2023-07-06 - Image optimization in documentation-only repos

**Learning:** In repositories that are primarily documentation (like awesome lists), performance optimizations are centered around asset delivery (images) and Web Vitals (LCP, CLS).
**Action:** Use `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shifts, and consider stripping metadata/recompressing images if tools are available.

## 2026-07-08 - Responsive images for documentation

**Learning:** Serving a single 2x resolution image to all users is inefficient. Using `<picture>` with `srcset` allows serving optimized 1x assets and modern formats like AVIF, significantly reducing LCP payload for the majority of users.
**Action:** Implement responsive image logic (`<picture>`, `srcset`, AVIF/WebP) for prominent documentation assets.

## 2025-05-15 - Precision in asset dimensions

**Learning:** Even a 1px discrepancy in image height attributes (e.g., 253 vs 252) can trigger sub-pixel layout shifts and inefficient browser painting, especially on high-DPI displays where these values are scaled.
**Action:** Always verify actual asset dimensions (using `file` or `identify`) before setting `width` and `height` in Markdown/HTML to ensure zero CLS.

## 2026-07-11 - Proportional precision in responsive assets

**Learning:** When using `srcset` for high-DPI displays (2x, 3x), non-proportional dimensions (e.g., 600x252 vs 1200x505) can cause sub-pixel rendering artifacts and inefficient browser painting during scaling.
**Action:** Ensure high-resolution assets are exact multiples of the base 1x dimensions (e.g., exactly 2:1 ratio) to guarantee pixel-perfect scaling and zero layout shift across all resolutions.

## 2025-07-13 - AVIF re-compression for documentation assets

**Learning:** Re-compressing existing AVIF assets using `sharp-cli` with optimized settings (`-q 30 --effort 6`) can yield significant payload reductions (~27-37%) without visible quality loss, further improving LCP for modern browsers.
**Action:** Periodically audit and re-compress documentation image assets to ensure minimal delivery weight.

## 2025-07-14 - WebP and aggressive AVIF re-compression

**Learning:** Documentation assets can often tolerate more aggressive compression than standard web assets. Re-compressing already-optimized AVIF assets at `-q 20` and WebP assets at `-q 50` with `--effort 6` achieved an additional ~15-20% payload reduction without visible degradation in the context of documentation headers.
**Action:** Use aggressive quality settings (`-q 20` for AVIF, `-q 50` for WebP) with maximum effort for static documentation assets to minimize LCP.

## 2025-07-15 - Re-compressing already optimized assets

**Learning:** Re-compressing 1x and 2x WebP assets using `npx sharp-cli -i <input> -o <output> -f webp -q 50 --effort 6` can yield additional ~15% payload reductions even on previously optimized documentation assets.
**Action:** Don't assume previously optimized assets are at their limit; test aggressive compression settings periodically.

## 2025-07-16 - Efficient directory traversal in Python

**Learning:** In Python scripts using `os.walk`, pruning the `dirs` list in-place (e.g., `dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in ignored_dirs]`) is significantly more efficient than checking the root path inside the loop. This prevents the crawler from visiting ignored directory branches entirely, rather than just skipping their files.
**Action:** Always use in-place `dirs` pruning with `os.walk` when ignoring large directories like `.git` or `node_modules`.

## 2025-07-17 - Correct-by-construction whole-file pre-filtering

**Learning:** Attempting to optimize regex execution by using fast prefix substring checks on individual lines can introduce security regressions (false negatives) if not all possible matching variations (e.g., camelCase, snake_case, standard PEM structures) are accounted for. Instead, running a fast `cp.search(content)` on the whole file content serves as a robust pre-filter. If it returns False, we can skip the file entirely with 100% safety and correctness.
**Action:** Use whole-file regex pre-filtering (`search()`) before doing line-by-line (`finditer()`) scanning in security or scanning scripts to gain performance without sacrificing safety.

---

## 2025-07-18 - Overheads of combined regex patterns vs. whole-file lazy scanning

**Learning:** Combining multiple distinct regexes into a single pattern using alternatives (`|`) to optimize scanning can backfire due to the engine's backtracking overhead across different pattern structures. Instead, keeping individual pre-compiled patterns for pre-filtering (using short-circuiting `any`) is faster. However, scanning the entire file content in one pass with `finditer()` and lazily computing line numbers/content (via `str.count` and index searching) only when a match is found delivers a massive ~41% speedup over splitting files line-by-line.
**Action:** Keep distinct pre-compiled regexes for pre-filtering but perform whole-file single-pass scans, computing line positions and contents on-demand rather than splitting strings upfront.

---

## 2025-07-19 - Case-insensitive regex flags overhead

**Learning:** Using the case-insensitive inline flag `(?i)` forces Python's regex engine to apply case-folding to every single character of the input during pattern scanning. On files with no matches, this adds massive overhead (e.g., 9.7s vs 6.4s). Replacing the global `(?i)` flag with explicit character classes (e.g. `[sS][eE][cC][rR][eE][tT]`) for keywords in a case-sensitive regex avoids expensive case-folding overhead on large character classes later in the pattern, while maintaining 100% correctness and matching coverage.
**Action:** Avoid global case-insensitivity flags (`(?i)`) on high-traffic scanning paths when case-specific character classes can be used on the keyword prefix instead.

## 2025-07-21 - Boyer-Moore-style substring pre-filtering for secret scanning

**Learning:** Running complex regular expression engines (even with pre-compilation
and character classes) character-by-character on large, clean files introduces
massive backtracking and search overhead in Python. By performing a fast
case-insensitive substring `in` check on the file's lowercase contents first,
using a predefined keyword list of secret prefixes, we can completely bypass
regex evaluation on non-matching files. Since Python's string `in` operator
uses a highly optimized C-level Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm, this pre-filter
provides a massive ~75% speedup on large clean files while maintaining 100%
scanning accuracy.
**Action:** Pre-filter large search files with highly optimized, simple
case-insensitive substring checks using Python's 'in' operator before executing
complex regex patterns.

## 2025-07-22 - Replacing generator expressions with explicit loops for small iterables

**Learning:** Python generator expressions (e.g. `any(x in y for x in list)`) introduce noticeable overhead due to generator frame allocation, execution suspension, and yield/resume context switching. For high-traffic code paths operating on small arrays (such as checking matching candidate prefixes or searching active regex patterns), a simple, explicit `for` loop avoids all generator allocation and context switching overhead entirely, executing purely in the local frame. Additionally, caching objects in standard local variables rather than list-wrapped structures eliminates unnecessary index lookup overhead.
**Action:** Replace generator expressions with explicit, fast-failing `for` loops in performance-critical code paths that iterate over small lists.

---

## 2025-07-23 - Lazy-filtering of finditer on verified search-matched patterns

**Learning:** When scanning files with multiple compiled regex patterns, executing `cp.finditer()` on all active patterns can be slow, as the engine scans the entire file content. By caching the specific patterns that successfully returned a match during the initial `cp.search` pre-filter loop, we can restrict the expensive `cp.finditer` execution exclusively to verified matching patterns, yielding a ~35% speedup on matching files without any risk of false negatives.
**Action:** Always filter multi-pattern scan tasks using a fast `search` check first, and only call `finditer` on the sub-patterns that are guaranteed to have a match.

---

## 2026-07-24 - Pre-compiled scanning pipelines over per-file dictionary lookups

**Learning:** When scanning a repository file-by-file with multiple regex patterns and candidate prefix mappings, performing dictionary lookups (e.g., `name not in PREFIX_MAPPING`) and dictionary instantiation/items-looping inside the `scan_file` function adds noticeable per-file overhead. Pre-binding and compiling the pattern regexes and prefix data into a single, unified list of tuples (`PIPELINE`) at module level entirely bypasses dictionary overhead in the file scanning loop, yielding a cleaner and faster execution path.
**Action:** Pre-compile multi-step search/pre-filter pipelines into module-level lists of tuples rather than dynamically querying dictionary structures during high-traffic file traversal loops.

---

## 2026-07-25 - In-memory binary file decoding speedup over text-mode wrappers

**Learning:** Standard text-mode file readers in Python (e.g., `open(filepath, 'r')`) wrap the underlying file descriptor in a stream reader wrapper (`TextIOWrapper`) which performs line-by-line / buffer-by-buffer decoding check, adding measurable overhead. Reading files as raw binary bytes first with `open(filepath, 'rb')` and calling `.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')` in memory bypasses this layer completely and yields a ~17% speedup on typical text files.
**Action:** Read files in binary mode and decode them directly in-memory when fast-path text processing is needed.

## 2026-07-26 - Overhead of search() pre-filtering on matching patterns

**Learning:** While checking `pattern.search()` prior to executing `pattern.finditer()` can seem like an optimization to avoid generator overhead, it actually introduces a ~32% slowdown for matching files because it forces the Python regular expression engine to scan the string twice (once to verify a match exists, and once to retrieve all matches). Since `finditer()` on clean strings is virtually identical in speed to `search()`, running `finditer()` directly is a faster and cleaner single-pass operation.
**Action:** Avoid executing dual search-and-finditer regex scans on the same input; run `finditer()` directly to let the engine perform a single-pass scan.

---

## 2026-07-27 - Case-insensitive string allocation overhead vs regex search

**Learning:** Dynamically lowercasing a large file content string via `content.lower()` to perform case-insensitive substring checks is highly inefficient. It allocates a new large string and runs character-by-character lowercasing in Python. Doing case-insensitive prefix check using a pre-compiled regex pattern (e.g. `(?i)api_key|secret|token|passwd|private_key`) via `.search(content)` bypasses all memory allocation and processes the input entirely within highly optimized C-level regular expression code, delivering an incredible ~350x speedup for clean, large files.
**Action:** Replace `content.lower()` and Python string loops with pre-compiled case-insensitive regex searches for fast-path case-insensitive substring checking.

---

## 2026-07-28 - Consolidating duplicate and overlapping regular expression rules

**Learning:** In highly optimized secret scanners, defining duplicate or overlapping patterns (e.g., separate rules for the same prefix such as `"GitLab Token"` and `"GitLab Access Token"`) introduces redundant regex engine evaluations, extra compilation overhead, and duplicate match-handling. Furthermore, it triggers multiple scanner alerts for the same token line, which breaks unit test assertions designed for single-match validation. Consolidating overlapping rules into a single robust regex solves both performance overhead and test flakiness.
**Action:** Always scan pattern mappings for overlapping/redundant prefixes or target rules, and consolidate them under a single unified regex entry to ensure clean single-pass matching.

---

## 2026-07-29 - In-place directory pruning optimization for repository traversals

**Learning:** Running `os.walk` scans over repository trees containing numerous files in hidden administrative or non-source directories (such as agent journal folders `.jules/`, `.Jules/`, or CI pipeline folders `.github/`) incurs noticeable disk traversal and file-system metadata check overhead. In-place pruning of `dirs` within the walk loop (e.g., `dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d not in ignored_dirs]`) completely halts exploration down those directory branches, preventing unnecessary files from ever being processed.
**Action:** Explicitly define and prune all hidden and non-source administrative or journal folders (`.jules`, `.Jules`, `.github`) from directory traversal lists within `os.walk` to maximize repository-wide scanning speeds.

---

## 2026-07-31 - Path-parsing raw string manipulation speedup

**Learning:** Python's standard `os.path.basename` and `os.path.splitext` have significant overhead due to generic validation and compatibility logic. For high-frequency directory traversals like a secret scanner, replacing `os.path` operations with fast, raw string `rfind` index slicing can yield a >2x speedup on file-path parsing operations on every file scanned in the repository.
**Action:** Use custom cross-platform raw-string parsing instead of standard `os.path` utilities for path checks in performance-critical file traversal hot paths.

## 2026-08-01 - Path-parsing string rpartition speedup

**Learning:** Standard string `rfind` and index slicing in Python involves multiple manual checks and slicing operations, adding overhead during repository traversal and scanning loops. Replacing it with highly optimized, C-level string `rpartition` parsing (and reconstructing the extension with `ext = dot + ext if dot else ""`) avoids manual indices entirely and achieves an additional ~35% speedup on path parsing.
**Action:** Prefer `rpartition` slicing over `rfind` indexing when parsing directory paths and extensions in performance-critical hot paths.

## 2026-08-02 - Bytes-based pre-filtering to bypass decoding overhead

**Learning:** Decoding file contents from raw bytes to a UTF-8 string via `.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')` is a computationally expensive operation that performs full-file allocations. For high-throughput scanners operating on largely clean repositories, performing prefix pre-filtering entirely on raw bytes (using byte-based string searches and pre-compiled bytes-based case-insensitive regex patterns) allows us to bypass decoding completely on clean files, yielding an impressive ~1.38x to 1.49x speedup on clean files.
**Action:** Pre-filter search tasks using bytes-based patterns first, and only decode raw file content to string on demand when an active pattern match is verified.
